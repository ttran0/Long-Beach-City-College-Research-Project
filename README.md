With the support of the Institutional Research Department at Long Beach City College, I was given 10 years of college wide student data to provide them with any insights. For the purpose of privacy, the data will not be displayed in the notebook. However, I can provide desciptions and the variables that are being used along with results from the analysis. 
The topic that interests me about education data is determining patterns to improve the retention and persistance rates. Retention and persistance is one of, if not the most, important topics in higher education. In my analysis, I will explore the data and implement machine learning models to predict whether a student will return to school to improve retention rates.
